## Translations for humans

A flexible FREE and UNLIMITED node package to translate between different languages in a simple way using multiple translators.

> **_NOTE:_**  Dolmetscher is a german word that refers to a person who professionally translates statements in a foreign language.

 Dolmetscher supports the google and mymemory translator, which gives flexibility to the user to choose the translator he wants to use or to compare & automate translations.

## Why you should use dolmetscher?

- most of translation library for node are buggy and does not work properly
- dolmetscher is stable and maintained regularly
- dolmetscher is lightweight and fast
- dolmetscher depends only on the axios library, not like other packages, which depend on multiple other packages.

## Motivation
There are other libraries that can be used for this task, but let's face it, most of them are buggy, not free, limited, not supported anymore or complex to use.

Therefore, I decided to build this simple tool. It is 100% free, unlimited, easy to use and provide support for all languages.

Basically, my goal was to integrate support for multiple famous translators in this tool.

This package idea is inspired from my python   [**deep_translator**](https://github.com/nidhaloff/deep_translator) package, where multiple translators are integrated in one too.

## Features:
- Support for **google translator**
- Simple text translation
- Batch translation
- File translation
- Support for the **Mymemory translator** (version >= 0.0.3)


## Installation

```
npm install dolmetscher --save
```

## Usage

##### Imports

```js

const {GoogleTranslator, MymemoryTranslator} = require('dolmetscher');

```
### Google Translator:
In this section, usage example of the GoogleTranslator are provided

##### Check supported languages
```js
// you can check the supported languages first 
console.log("google translate supported languages are: ", GoogleTranslator.getSupportedLanguages());

```

##### Simple Text Translation

```js
/*
- you need to create a GoogleTranslator object.
- the first argument is the target language to translate to
- the second argument is the source language (default to auto)
- provide the text you want to translate as an argument to the translate function

*/
const google = new GoogleTranslator('en', 'auto');

google.translateText("bonjour la vie").then(res => console.log("translatedText: ", res));

```

- Alternatively you can use the async/await syntax:

```js

async function translate() {
    let google = new GoogleTranslator('en', 'auto');

    try {
        const res = await google.translateText("bonjour la vie");
        return res;
    }

    catch(err) {
        console.log("translation error: ", err);
    }
    
}


```

##### Batch Translation

```js

const google = new GoogleTranslator('en', 'auto');
 const texts = ['bonsoir le monde', 'Hallo Welt', 'guten morgen'];

google.translateBatch(texts)
            .then(res => console.log("batch translation: ", res));

```

##### File Translation

```js

const google = new GoogleTranslator('en', 'auto');
const filePath = 'your_file_path.txt';

google.translateFile(f)
            .then(res => console.log("translated file: ", res));

```

### Mymemory Translator:
In this section, usage example of the MymemoryTranslator are provided

##### Check supported languages
```js
// you can check the supported languages first 
console.log("Mymemory supported languages are: ", MymemoryTranslator.getSupportedLanguages());

```

##### Simple Text Translation

```js
/*
- the first argument is the target language to translate to
- the second argument is the source language (provide this argument for better results)
- Finally, provide the text you want to translate as an argument to the translate function

*/
const mymemory = new MymemoryTranslator("fr", "en");

mymemory.translateText("keep it up, you are awesome")
.then(res => console.log("mymemory result: ", res));

```


##### Batch Translation

```js

const mymemory = new MymemoryTranslator("fr", "en");

const texts = ["Hello world", "How are you"];

mymemory.translateBatch(texts)
.then(res => console.log("mymemory result: ", res));

```

##### File Translation

```js

const mymemory = new MymemoryTranslator("en", "de");
const filePath = 'your_file_path.txt';

mymemory.translateFile(filePath)
.then(res => console.log("mymemory result: ", res));

```
